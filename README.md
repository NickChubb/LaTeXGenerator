# LaTeXGenerator v1.0

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

After growing tired of managing my LaTeX dependencies and changes to my LaTeX notes formats over the years, I've decided to make myself a desktop app to manage how my LaTeX projects are managed.

My LaTeXGenerator uses Python (with Tkinter for GUI) to create myself new project folders in a logical/proper way.
